            we've got six years left to make as much money as we can before we don't understand how the economy works anymore
            is it too late in crypto it's a three trillion dollar industry if we just
            extrapolate the trend rate of growth and the number of wallets and all of that stuff we get to 100 trillion by
            20134 we're 3% of the way there you got to fight yourself in this market it's
            always your own psychologies your most your worst enemy when it just feels the worst that's when you should be putting
            as much money in as you can
            hi and welcome to speak up I'm your host Anthony scaramucci and I have my handsome guest and good friend rul pal
            and I just have to point out that the women in this office are crushing on you so if your wife listens to these things
            she needs to know step up your game girl all right now rul is the founder and CEO
            Global macro investor and also the founder of real vision uh so many different things though
            prominent entrepreneur investment strategist former hedge fund manager
            former Goldman Sachs uh employee in London uh known for investing in crypto
            Bitcoin particularly Bitcoin other insights and macro Trends but truth be
            told I just think you're an awesome guy and you are ahead of the curve you've seen things before other people uh and
            now other people are starting to see the things that you have seen and so the question is where do we go now so let's
            start there uh I want to start with Bitcoin first if you don't mind so as I'm talking time horiz give me a time
            Horizon as well because I can yeah so I'm gonna say to you over the next three to six months what happens to bitcoin
            and then what happens to bitcoin over the next five years and then I want you to go into the macro but I want to start
            with Bitcoin because I think it's important I'm talking to you where Bitcoin is at 92,000 you're also talking to a person
            that did buy Bitcoin at 68 8,000 November of 2021 rode it down to 17,000
            so you're talking to a battle torn scarred human being did you did you add
            to your trade when it went lower I did no absolutely no I absolutely then it
            works wonders right no no no I added no no I've been I've been a consistent buyer every month of Bitcoin since
            October of 2020 uh and even in the down times when I thought I was getting to get creamed I
            was nibbling I can't say I was buying as much in my overconfidence zel as 68,000
            prints uh I was less confident at 177,000 isn't that how human nature Works Ro always it's you got to fight
            yourself in this market it's always your own psychologies your most your worst enemy I've learned from being in this
            cycle for so long that really if you can when it just feels the worst that's when
            you should be putting as much money in as you can obviously it's also the hardest time because nobody's got money
            because liquidity is being drawn out of the system everyone's feeling the pinch so it's actually hard to scrape Pennies
            from under the sofa but it is the best strategy of all because your gains compound so fast when you do it well
            well I I I'm with you on that I've learned that in my old age I tell younger people just nibble at things
            make an investment every month and don't look at it pay yourself first but where's Bitcoin going to be three six
            months and then give me your fiveyear outlook yeah I mean I try not to give price projections and I know you always pin them out of me but the point being
            is you know we're very public on social media and it's just people pin their hopes and dreams on a number you give
            them but the my general thesis is we will rally into year end we will correct
            at some point there's a bunch of hedge funds and raas and others who are into this who will need to take a bit of
            profits into year end I think we'll get a bit of a ShakeOut Global liquidity slowing down somewhat and then we should
            re accelerate into the end of tax season so my view is Bitcoin easily gets to 100
            this year um and probably probably is you know 150 plus
            by March before it corrects again and then we finish the year after a larger
            correction with a very strong rally into the end so that's that's how I think it plays out probabilistically so when you
            say a correction we're at 150 it corrects back to 80 yeah maybe something like that yeah maybe less maybe you know
            30% correction so back down to 100 kind of make sense to me right um and it'll
            feel miserable and people say has the cycle peaked and all of that noise right and then usually we end the second year
            after the presidential election cycle very strong and then it Peaks out sometimes
            there okay so if I give a range of targets as opposed to pinpointing a Target worst Cas is 150 my base case is
            250 and in an obscene bull market because everybody's buying driven by a
            change of Regulation then it could go as high as 450 okay let's go to salana I want to ask you the same questions
            related to salana because I know you're a ball there yeah so I think salana finishes this
            year closer to 400 than it is to 200 so I think we got this year six weeks ago
            maybe 350 I mean it's a higher bass so it should do better um so I expect that
            to happen um I'm I
            think again it'll follow the same kind of price path as Bitcoin but it should outperform all of the way it's been in
            this consolidation versus Bitcoin uh sideways consolidation the next leg should be altcoin season and salana
            should be the king of the major alts so I'm kind of expecting salana from here to probably
            get to over over a th000 12 1250 something like that all right last one
            ethereum um ethereum has been a lagged I think it plays some catchup I think it outperforms Bitcoin going forwards for a
            bit because you know if we sit back and look at what the regulatory changes might be that is the platform upon which
            most of the institutions will start doing stuff it's the Microsoft decision you know every bank has Microsoft
            computers not Apple Computers so I think that um ethereum actually does better than most people expect going into the
            end of the year again same price pattern um outperforms Bitcoin salana outperforms ethereum so it's the risk
            curve I want to go to the macroeconomy for a second so I don't know maybe I'm
            crazy uh the the US voter says they don't like the economy but when I look
            at the economic data Maybe I'm insulated because I've made a decent amount of money I don't say that to be arrogant or
            anything like that maybe I'm insulated maybe I've lost my touch with the common person but wages
            are rising unemployment's at an all-time low stock markets at an all-time high uh
            General numbers like PPI Etc manufacturing look good to me they don't look bad uh uh feds cutting rates so
            what am I what are people so upset about and obviously they voted it's been anti-incumbency throughout the West
            that's right and so no surprise that the incumbent was voted out but what what what what do you think two factors here
            one is inflation has slowed down but the prices have stuck you know and that's a
            hard thing for people to take we all complain every time we go to a restaurant you go to the supermarket you're like really is this prices I'm
            paying these days and people haven't made that back and the one reason we haven't really made it back is the
            business cycle so if we look at the ism survey The Institute of Supply manager survey which is the guide to the global
            business cycle it's actually been below 50 which means it's in sort of
            contraction for the longest period in history now I think so there's something
            going on with the economy um and I think it's because the FED took so long to raise rate to cut
            rates because they were fighting the inflation demon of the past they took too long and that's kept a bulk of the
            economy slow so if you translate that to the ordinary person if you're running a sandwich shop in Manhattan or you're
            running a you know a dry cleaners in Chicago You're not seeing the money come
            in yet you're not seeing growth your business grow now the forward-looking indicators suggest we will get that and
            we'll get strong growth coming forwards but really to get that business cycle turning we still need the FED to cut
            further are you concerned about your financial future or think your Investments could be doing better I'm
            Andrew Brill one of the hosts here on weon and I've been there not sure my money was in the right places it's why
            I've gotten help from a financial adviser maybe it's time you think more about your financial future or get a
            second opinion about your Investments we've made that process easy simply go to wealth on.com free to speak with one
            of wealth On's registered investment advisers for a free no obligation portfolio review again that's wealth
            on.com free I'm now less anxious and confident I can achieve the financial
            goals I've set for me and my family okay so we're going to have a
            good four year I feel like I feel like let me let me channel Joe Biden at least
            when Joe Biden's not Sund Downing let me channel him I'm going to take the sunglasses off and channel him and say
            you know I inherited a little bit of a mess postco I cleaned it up I gave the FED good General Direction they
            tightened up rates tamed inflation I had three or four big legislative
            accomplishments I'm reshoring microprocessor foundaries I've got the manufacturing act that's helping us
            resore Manufacturing I am cleaning up the bridges roads and tunnels through the inflation reduction act uh cost of
            goods services are going to go lower because of those things uh I've set this thing up nicely for the incoming
            president uh is that how he feels I think he probably would you know if he'd say you know what was the one thing he
            didn't need that probably lost him the election it was the Russian invasion of Ukraine right because that was put the
            last leg of prices higher right um you know oil prices oil prices too oil
            prices and food prices because of the disruptions of the supply chain that came from all of that because of um
            everything from Russian fertilizers through to natural gas so I think if he would look back and say you know what
            really went wrong in an economy that was doing decently well it was that and that led the FED to keep rates higher than
            normally would have done and that's what really cost him a lot of the election
            right okay so uh let's talk about Mr
            Trump for a second the president president-elect Trump um what could go right and what could go
            wrong so on the right side I think freeing up of the economy if he
            does fulfill the role that some people expect him to do which is the Reagan style um deregulation freeing up of the
            economy uh bringing back kind of industry back to the
            us and allowing technology to move forward and crypto to move forward you're going to potentially reignite the
            US economy the flip side is there's a big debate about tariffs are they going to be inflationary the other issue
            people don't realize is tariffs plus reduced deficit spending means less dollars in the global system means a
            strong dollar which is slows down World growth and creates other problems so I
            think if there's anything it's on that side it's on you know his policies that he talks about now are very very strong
            dollar and strong dollar generally slows World growth pretty badly um and that could screw things up so let's wait and
            see but it means that the US can't export so easily if that's the case obviously um okay what do you think
            about the relationship that the United States is going to have with the other
            Western democracies in Trump to and how will that if at all impact the economy
            I think it is more isolationist and we've seen you know Trump one was isolationist I don't see
            Trump two not being isolationist um so I think that creates
            friction obviously with the EU um tra friction with China and I think it's
            just going to force that Trend that we have seen even under Biden you know the inflation reduction Act was partly to do
            with this is we're just going to have to come home with our manufacturing and have less Supply chains so
            it's going to create a bit of hostility but as you said all of the governments are changing now anyway now the UK's
            just flipped super left after being right it looks like um Germany's going
            to flip right from being left you know it's very difficult to deal with what set of leaders have what set of we don't
            have a cohesive worldview right now so it is going to feel more isol isolationist I think than you know let's
            say under the Clinton years and even the bush years where we had a pretty strong worldview we don't have that
            anymore is is Donald Trump going to get rid of the Central Bank of the United
            States no I think that's all rhetoric to appease the the Libertarians I don't
            think he wants to do that and can do that I don't think the system is even ready for it yet you know we don't yeah
            so I I think not I think that's more rhetoric than anything else is Donald Trump going to put one million Bitcoins
            on the balance sheet of the United States on the Federal Reserve balance sheet first I think this is a bit of a
            red hering because as the world's Reserve currency you don't need to hold reserves
            in anything else right so that's why the the US doesn't hold a basket of euros and Yen
            and other doesn't need to it's the world Reserve currency so they don't actually need currency reserves or or
            national reserves they have a legacy of gold of which we don't how much is there so the way to do this is probably to say
            well any Bitcoin or cryptocurrency that's been seized we'll put it in the reserve and that's a way of appeasing
            the crypto crowd without I mean there's no point to have a a reserve I mean
            maybe they do maybe they think that that's going to help them but the worst thing it's going to do is just strengthen the
            dollar even further and that that is not good a very strong dollar is a wrecking
            ball for the the rest of the world and without global trade and Global demand everyone goes through a recession so you
            got to kind of be careful of what you wish for okay uh this is why I love
            talking to you by the way because you think of things that I don't think of which is why I like being on TV with you
            okay let's go to the what we're calling the exponential age which is the rapid
            advancement of AI blockchain and other Technologies so Mr Paul you think
            there's a Boom coming right there's a techno Boom coming it's a techno boom and it's Unstoppable and it's going to
            be so fast we don't know how to deal with it am I going to be taller as a result of this no is there chance no it
            might be possible there is hope for you yet hope for me yet okay there there is hope for you there is hope for you yet I
            think that's I think that's why I have a little bit of jealousy towards you is not only you're good-look but you're a tall son of a okay tell us about
            the exponential age go ahead so look it's this Nexus of all of these Technologies all hitting adoption
            effects at the same time you can see that in front of your eyes with crypto that's what number go up but AI we can
            see that every three months there like a groundbreaking set of new models whether it's video audio or just the models
            themselves or the applications of it we're seeing the robots coming we've seen the Optimus robots we've seen the robots coming out of China we're seeing
            Tesla cars we're seeing I mean it's just endless we're seeing Amazon employing more robots than humans now and that's
            accelerating then we've got the biotechnology stuff we've got you know Google with their with their Alpha fold
            which is the AI based around um predicting protein sequences and what
            that can do for Humanity we're seeing so much all happening at the same time EV I mean nobody realizes because it becomes
            politicized but solar growth the growth of solar power is more than all of other
            energy generation added together and doubled and people don't realize how
            fast this technology is moving as well and how much the prices are coming down so all of these things mean the price of
            Compu is going lower the price of energy and electricity will go lower over time nuclear can be thrown into that and then
            you've got AI which H is driving exponential compute which ends up with
            infinite human knowledge all of these things are so disruptive we can't get our heads around them um
            and it's quite difficult to invest in a lot of it a lot of it is in VC hands or
            in these giant tech companies so you got this fastest growing technology in all history what are you supposed to do by
            Microsoft yeah you might double your money or triple your money but it's it's not really commensurate with that so the
            crypto side of the equation because the whole new internet is being built on crypto rails I mean the AI will have
            identity and we will have identity on chain you know many of the things you and I have talked about the larger use
            of blockchain as a technology well that's front and center so I actually I actually think we've got six years and
            this is quite contentious I think we've got six years left to make as much money as we can before we don't understand how
            the economy works anymore we've got if an economy is driven by if economic
            Trend rate of economic growth is driven by population growth plus productivity growth and debt
            growth by the time you change this aging population which is slowing Trend rate of GDP down replace that with infinite
            robots and infinite AI we've replaced the population component same with
            productivity by lowering energy cost we end up with ridiculous growth I mean what are financial markets with AGI so I
            think we got six years so actually we do a lot of this on real Vision so anybody watching this realvision tocom jooin
            there's a whole stuff around the six years it's really important I think we've got six years to invest to save
            our futures or cement our futures let's go to questions
            R and Anthony what advice would you give young people just starting in finance to have a great career like yours that's
            Ryan from California so go ahead I give I give this advice to a lot of friends
            kids because they're like I want to go into Finance I'm like Finance is a secularly declining
            industry you know if I I was comparing notes with a mate of mine who's just left Finance at the same age I was
            earning three times as much money as them the the the the amount of opportunity in finance keeps going down
            as guess what AI technology replaces humans in the trading flaw um and in
            Investment Banking across I would not go into Finance if you're going to go into Finance go into crypto crypto is a
            secular Trend going up the fastest of all um as opposed to a secular Trend going down which is the traditional
            Finance system so if you want to apply your Finance understanding you want to do investing you want to think about
            macro do it in crypto and it'll change your life the key to anybody's career is
            find a secular Trend and ride that you you and I rode the same secular Trend hedge funds was a huge Trend as was
            Finance at the time and on my side it was Equity derivatives which was a huge Trend we rode those it makes us look
            Geniuses even though I'm certainly not a genius you're smarty you got to you went to Harvard or somewhere I didn't I I did
            I did go to Harvard and uh don't hold it against me because uh you know in some
            ways it stunts your ability to see things you know you get you know Ross perau you're old enough to remember Ross
            perau the legendary uh entrepreneur who also ran for president in 1992 he said
            something that I'll never forget Ro he said at Harvard Business School when I was there he said I feel bad for you
            babies why do you feel bad for us he said you're at Harvard you're at Harvard
            you were successful in the first part of your life you're not going to take any risks you're not going want to do anything stupid or crazy and I left the
            big impression on me I left that meeting and said I'm for stupid and I'm for crazy and that's why I'm a bitcoiner
            like you but is it too late is it too late in crypto no it's a it's currently
            today A3 trillion doll industry think of this scale it's a three trillion dollar
            industry if we just extrapolate the trend rate of growth and the number of wallets and all of that stuff we get to
            100 trillion by 2034 we're 3% of the way there we've got 97
            trillion of wealth to create in this space we've barely started and know we all use that phrase you know we're so
            early but the adoption of this technology is the financial system starts to operate on its rails you have
            instant settlement for equities and bonds and all of that the transfer payments even Central Bank digital
            currencies are on these rails everything folds into these rails R ID gaming
            worlds all of these things well if it's if with 3% of the journey it's all to
            play for this is the biggest Trend we've ever had go to the next question from a macro perspective what
            roadblocks at delivering on campaign promises do you foresee the Trump 2.0
            Administration encountering in the first year this is Moren from Pennsylvania that's is more one for you
            to answer because I don't really know you're more used to the ins and outs of theal system I guess I guess what I
            would say to Moren and others is that there are systemss and formal processes
            in place that slowed down the last Trump Administration you know and will likely
            slow down this Administration now the administration is trying to hop over some certain systems they don't want to
            do FBI background checks they want the Senate to immediately confirm their people with very little uh deliberation
            in the Senate body and things like that but I I don't think the system set up like that you know uh if you like Donald
            Trump and you see him as an agent for change uh he will make changes but the
            truth be told that system in Washington has a very big immunity the
            immunological system to reject an antigen like Donald Trump is in place G
            to make it hard for him so I don't think A lot's going to change Raul I think on the margin some things will maybe a tax
            cut here or there maybe maybe an eliminate elimination the salt deduction
            which he's saying he's going to do allow us to return back to deducting our state and local income taxes I don't know
            we'll we'll see but I don't I kind of I kind of that same way as well is the political process is a
            quagmire and you can say a lot but what ends up getting done is much less think
            of Obama he got a clear mandate he struggled after the you know even after
            the midterms after the first year it's just really hard to get stuff done so we'll see okay let's go to the next
            one R what would be India's stock market situation in the next three months or
            longterm Manisha from India so if we think about that that Trend rate of GDP
            formula that question is for me Ro really because I'm I'm the Indian on this I'm kidding go ahead keep going if
            the trend rate of GDP is driven by population growth a working age population growth plus productivity
            growth plus debt growth Indian households have low debt Indian government has decent amounts of debt
            households are low leverage productivity is going to be from building roads putting in the the
            infrastructure that's required and population growth comes from the fact that the average age is 28 this is like
            golden demographics so India over a long-term time Horizon is very good uh
            the only thing that can upset that apple cart for a while would be a very strong dollar but it's being offset currently
            by falling oil prices which is the big input for India so I've just I've been bullish India for a decade it's been the
            best performing Market in the world for a long time now so keep going all right let's fire in another
            question what is your outlook for financial Mortgage in the next year a je from Canada that's for you my brother up
            up yeah I I agree I I don't see anything stopping this and lots of earnings by
            the way lots of earnings up up upside surprises let's go to the next
            question what are your thoughts on ai's potential impact on job markets especially in finance and other
            knowledge Industries this is Lisa from the UK so firstly we will notice that as
            the business cycle expands this time around they'll hire less people you know
            investment Banks generally when Times Are Good Start piling on the people and then fire a bunch of them I think we'll
            see less of that so and then when it comes to the downturns they'll just be cutting leener so I think the number of
            people working in finance and knowledge Industries lawyers accountants paral leals all of those kind of things will
            just be declining as a percentage of the um of the overall Workforce I don't
            think there's a mass layoff you know we're all firing our lawyers I just think as firms grow over time naturally
            with the economy they'll just hire less and less people um which is also fine
            because we've got an aging population so a lot of people are falling out of the labor force um but yeah that's
            definitely the case so I think unemployment it's starting to rise a little bit it probably remains stickier
            for longer and then the next cycle it picks up a bit more it's just this slow change you know it's not like the steel
            mills in Pittsburgh shut down overnight it's a process yeah it's not an instant
            thing yep I agree with you on all those things let's go to the next question why do assets like lower price
            houses increase in value in line with liquidity and depreciating dollar why do
            assets like lower price houses increase in value in line with extra liquidity and depreciating dollars yeah so what
            from New York so what happens is when you debase a currency you don't really see it what happens is it looks like
            assets are rising but they're actually not it's because the purchasing power of your is going down so you're earning
            working your ass off every day earning money and you can buy less of a share of a house all the time that's because
            earnings are not driven by debasement because they're are variable input but this fixed asset gold real estate crypto
            equities are all scarce assets art wine and they all keep going up so that's why
            one of the reasons the rich get richer and the poor get poorer in this environment is this process of
            debasement so what you're seeing is that house prices they're not going up or down in value it's the purchasing power
            of the dollar that's going down in value that's the real issue here that's why we saw the 50% decline uh rise in house
            prices everywhere in 2020 2021 why because we printed a massive amount of
            money so it made the dollar less less valuable okay let's keep
            going what do you think about gold rose from Florida gold is is also driven by
            mon monetary debasement um and it follows Global M2 essentially um so I
            don't think the basement goes away because we've got to pay the interest on the debts and service the existing debts
            so gold probably goes higher I just like gold less than crypto because it's a similar trade but crypto has a much much
            higher beta and a higher risk adjusted return but gold should be fine all right let's keep going that right you know
            that's it you exhausted the questions okay and uh I don't know what is it Ro
            is it the smile is it the accent is it the salt and pepper hair what is it that
            we we don't know creates this Charisma about you what do you think it is I don't know it's probably it's probably just the smile in the English I when I
            do my health and beauty show on the wealth on network you'll be my first guest how's
            that uh yeah so what are you what are you thinking about markets I got to pick your
            brains well I'm GNA the biggest thing that I'm worried about which I've always
            been worried about in my career uh is when I'm not worried yeah and so there's
            an unknown unknown that I don't know I don't know are they're going to detonate a nuke somewhere that I don't expect is
            a are they going to launch missiles into Iran but there's something else there's a booby trap somewhere that we don't see
            you know my fear rul is that U I can't see
            what's wrong you know one of my very very close friends uh who's a big bitcoiner um and uh I just wrote a book
            a sailor wrote the introduction little book of Bitcoin I sent you an invite to the book party uh one of one of my
            friend said to me I can't figure out what's going to go wrong which makes me
            worry something's going to go wrong you know markets climb walls of worry what they don't climb is walls of exuberance
            because the exuberance gets overly priced in you know but I do think that there's a sea change happening right now
            and'll there'll be a lease for the first six months of next year a big leg up in the markets yeah I probably agree if we
            were to have a big event now what's interesting to me is I actually don't think we can have
            recessions because of debasement of currency a recession is really triggered triggered by credit events generally
            it's when your collateral goes down too much versus the debts and that's when the credit cycle plays in but if you
            debase the currency then the collateral doesn't go down so we didn't get a recession in 2022 staggering right
            nobody would have said that nobody now if I go back and be honest with myself I
            don't think 2020 would have been a recession without a pandemic either right and look how fast they turned it
            around exactly so I think something has structurally changed so if you said to me well what happens if China invades
            Taiwan I will say the markets will fall for about a week and then we'll go up in
            a straight line because they're just going to inject more liquidity right interesting and so that's a weird world
            we live in where actually these things are short-term downside risks and then maximum upside risk it's weird I love it
            all right my brother was great to have you on all right and I'll see you soon always good to see you yeah see you in person somewhere that's a wrap on
